# 🎮 Number Guessing Game

## 📝 Project Overview

This is a simple yet engaging number guessing game built with Python. The goal of the game is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on each guess, letting the player know if their guess was too low or too high. The player continues guessing until they correctly identify the number.

## 🚀 Features

- **Game Menu**:
  - Start a new game.
  - Exit the game.

- **Gameplay**:
  - The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
  - Players can input their guess and receive immediate feedback:
    - "Too low! Try again." if the guess is lower than the target number.
    - "Too high! Try again." if the guess is higher than the target number.
    - "Congratulations! You guessed the number in X attempts." when the correct number is guessed.
